UPDATE: The code has been revised and is from 2017 based on Auroracoin code.\n        <br/><br/>\n        A total of 50*10^9 (50 billion) coins will eventually be generated, half during the pre-mine phase.\n        <br/><br/>\n        Difficulty will be adjusted approximately every 5 days so as to obtain a new block every 3 minutes on average. This difficulty schedule aims to reduce the non-premined coins by 50% over 7 years. Modification: The difficulty computations were revised in August, 2015, after which difficulty is re-evaluated every 60 blocks, still with a goal to mine a new block every 3 minutes.\n        <br/><br/>\n        Main mining discussion thread: <a href = \"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=845761\">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=845761</a>\n        <br/><br/>\n        Mining pools are available: <a href = \"smly.hashlink.edu\" >smly.hashlink.edu</a>\n        <br/><br/>\n        Coin explorers: <a href = \"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/smly/\">https://chainz.cryptoid.info/smly/</a> and <a href = \"https://blocks.smileyco.in/\">https://blocks.smileyco.in/</a>\n        <br/><br/>\n        The SMLY is registered at cryptocoin exchanges, where it is possible to exchange SMLY for other electronic currencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) as well as Bitcoin (BTC).\n        See for example <a href = \"https://tradesatoshi.com/\">https://tradesatoshi.com/</a> <a href = \"https://www.southxchange.com/Market/Book/SMLY/LTC\">https://www.southxchange.com/Market/Book/SMLY/LTC</a>, and <a href = \"https://novaexchange.com/market/DOGE_SMLY/\">https://novaexchange.com/market/DOGE_SMLY/</a>\n        <br/><br/>\n        the tutor-web project provided a minimal mining capacity to ensure SMLY network functionality.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n  </div>\n      </section>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
