This documents describes the foundations of the SMLY. At the bottom of the document there is a list of proposed changes. The tutor-web system is a completely open and freely accessible educational system, with an emphasis on mathematics and statistics. This system has been tested in Europe and Africa, in high schools and universities. It is most commonly used by students who need to practice difficult topics. This is done in an online drill based environment intended to promote learning. Often an instructor will point the students to this resource and may use the tutor-web grade as a course grade. See the tutor-web info site for further information. The tutor-web pays students for completing their drills and exercises, using the Smileycoin currency. The actual amount paid varies from course to course. Currently a student gets one or a few SMLY for passing a lecture but many more (10, 100 or even 10000) for the highest grade. The student can download a SMLY wallet and redeem the earned SMLY into the wallet. The student can then pay a peer for tutoring using the Smileycoins earned in the system, buy coffee for the SMLY or exchange them for other currencies. To get a feel for the mission of the project, look at the TEDx Reykjav\\xEDk talk. Below is a description of the coin development. For actively updated information on the coin, go to the Bitcointalk page. The SmileyCoin Fund is a fund dedicated to education and technology.

SMLY wallets for Linux, Android and Windows are available for download. See the download page for more information on downloads and the uses page for more uses of the coin. In addition to these traditional wallets, an HTML5 wallet is available at https://wallet.smileyco.in The \\\"usual\\\" way of obtaining SMLY is by completing drills in the tutor-web system. One can also obtain SMLY by registering at an exchange for cryptocurrencies and buying SMLY. From November 2015, the SMLY can be used to buy cups of coffee in a coffee shop on the campus at the University of Iceland (experiment, initially supported by the Dean). Within the tutor-web, SMLY can be used to pay peer-tutors. A computer game, Smileybubble, available in the Google Playstore was used as a proof-of-concept game using SMLY for in-game purchases. The page at smly.is contains a web-store where users can buy discount coupons for an Icelandic domestic airline, a cinema, Amazon etc. Mining and coin information The following information is intended specifically for miners who help run the SMLY cryptocoin network. Attempts are made to keep it up-to-date, but the thread at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=845761 keeps a track record of the development. The tutor-web project pre-mined just under 50% of all coins. Since the initial phase, mining has been open to any miner.

SMLY wallets for Linux, Android and Windows are available for download. See the download page for more information on downloads and the uses page for more uses of the coin. In addition to these traditional wallets, an HTML5 wallet is available at https://wallet.smileyco.in\n\nThe \"usual\" way of obtaining SMLY is by completing drills in the tutor-web system. One can also obtain SMLY by registering at an exchange for cryptocurrencies and buying SMLY.\n\n\n\nFrom November 2015, the SMLY can be used to buy cups of coffee in a coffee shop on the campus at the University of Iceland (experiment, initially supported by the Dean).\n\nWithin the tutor-web, SMLY can be used to pay peer-tutors.\n\nA computer game, Smileybubble, available in the Google Playstore was used as a proof-of-concept game using SMLY for in-game purchases.\n\nThe page at smly.is contains a web-store where users can buy discount coupons for an Icelandic domestic airline, a cinema, Amazon etc.\n\nMining and coin information\n\n\nThe following information is intended specifically for miners who help run the SMLY cryptocoin network. Attempts are made to keep it up-to-date, but the thread at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=845761 keeps a track record of the development.\n\nThe tutor-web project pre-mined just under 50% of all coins. Since the initial phase, mining has been open to any miner. The opening date for mining was Nov. 24 2014, as announced on twitter (by @gstefans), on the main talk forum at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=845761.0;all and on https://www.altcoincalendar.info.\n        <br/><br/>\n        A few thousand students have taken courses using the SMLY.\n        <br/><br/>\n        The SMLY recently celebrated its second birthday, making it an established cryptocurrency and no longer a newcomer.\n        <br/><br/>\n        A separate project, Education In A Suitcase, uses the tutor-web and SMLY on servers and tablet computers distributed to very low-income regions of Africa.\n\n        <br/><br/>\n        The picture shows an EIAS member handing out crowdfunded tablets to students at the primary school on the island of Takawiri in Lake Victoria. The island has no Internet nor general electricity, but one of the school buildings has solar panels which give unstable electricity. The unstable electricity is all it takes for the system to run. The server has a complete copy of the tutor-web along with all of (English) Wikipedia and the Khan Academy math videos\n      </p>\n      <img src ={require('../../img/kenya.jpg')} alt = \"Image missing\" class = \"kenyaimg\"></img>\n      <p className = \"smlyabout__link\">\n        If you want to learn even more about Smileycoin here is <br/>\n        <a href=\"http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/103/84\">A peer-reviewed paper </a>\n        describing the Smileycoin in more detail than you ever wanted to hear!\n    </p>\n    <ul class = \"about__list\">More about smileycoin\n      <li class = \"about__list__item\"><a href= \"https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@gstefans/how-do-you-go-about-buying-cryptocurrency\">An elaborate introduction to how to get into crypto</a></li>\n      <li class = \"about__list__item\"><a href= \"https://steemit.com/smileycoin/@gstefans/making-coins-from-coins-with-no-effort\">An introduction to how the dividends work</a></li>\n      <li class = \"about__list__item\"><a href= \"https://steemit.com/blockchain/@gstefans/double-or-nothing-on-the-blockchain\">More on the double-or-nothing game</a></li>\n      <li class = \"about__list__item\"><a href= \"https://steemit.com/education/@gstefans/why-would-one-invest-in-an-altcoin\">An overview of why you might want to put real money into high-risk cryptocurrencies</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <div className = \"smlyabout__back\">\n      <Link to=\"/\" className = \"backLink\">Go back</Link>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n  </div>\n      </section>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
