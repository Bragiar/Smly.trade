So what is this electronic currency thing?
<img src="smiley3.png" alt="Smileycoin�" height="42" width="42">
</H1>
<p>
The Smileycoin works just like other electronic currencies such as 
Bitcoin, Litecoin or Dogecoin. 
It was introduced as a reward to be used in an on-line educational system.
You can find quite a bit more information if you look:

<p>
You first 
<a href="https://tutor-web.info/smileycoin/download">download
</a>
a wallet to store 
your coins. After this you can ask the wallet to generate an <b>address</b>
which you can freely send to anyone wanting to send you a Smileycoin.
</p>
<p>
Note that the various wallets know how to tell you the value of the Smileycoins in your wallet.
You can choose which currency you want to use as a reference currency.

How can you get SMLY?
<a name="donate">
</a> 
<img src="smiley3.png" alt="Smileycoin�" height="42" width="42">
</H1>
<h2>Easiest: Donate to Education in a Suitcase 
</h2>
<p>The project 
<a href="http://educationinasuitcase.com/">
Education in a Suitcase 
</a> 
will happily accept your donations.
In return for a donation, they will give you some Smileycoins.
</p>

<p>
Remember to use only small amounts while you are finding your way through this!
</p>

<p>
You will not make money from this transaction, but you will painlessly
get some Smileycoins which you can then use to test the
waters of electronic currencies.
</p>

<p>
Make sure you first <a href="https://tutor-web.info/smileycoin/download">have a SMLY wallet</a>!
</p>

<p>
It is easy to test this:
Just go to their 
<a href="http://educationinasuitcase.com/donation/en/index.html">donation page</a>
and 
send them five dollars. If you follow the instructions, then you will
quickly see some Smileycoins in your wallet.
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
Now, these donation pages are mostly in Icelandic at the time of this writing. 
You will want to know the following: 
<li>The amount is in Icelandic kronor. Very roughly, 1 USD=100 ISK</li>
<li>Hitting the "Styrkja..."="Donate..." button takes you to the next page</li>
<li>This takes you to a page where you (securely) give your credit card info</li>
<li>After you have made your donation, you will be offered Smileycoins</li>
<li>Just enter your Smileycoin wallet address and you will get some coins</li>

</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
This is a very good cause, worthy of your support. It is also an
exceptionally easy way to get into the world of
Smileycoin, Bitcoin and so forth.
</p>
<h2>
With work: Get SMLY by studying in the tutor-web system 
<a name="study"></a>
</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://tutor-web.net">tutor-web</a> system is a completely free
and open system of study. You can pick any course or study-unit (tutorial)
and study this to your hearts content by reading the available material and
(most importantly) answering drill questions. As you increase your grade
in those drills, you will get SMLY. Once you have SMLY you can download them
into a Smileycoin wallet.
</p>

<p>
</p>
<H2>
The long way: Buy SMLY at a cryptocurrency exchange
<a name="buy"></a>
</H2>
<p>Getting into the world of cryptocurrencies is a bit tricky. 
There are several hurdles to get started using cryptocoins and
buying your first SMLY is not quite trivial.</p>
<p>
You will always need to have an account at a 
cryptocurrency exchange. The exchanges at 
https://tradesatoshi.com/
https://c-cex.com and 
https://novaexchange.com/
have several "markets", i.e. places which look like a 
stock market and you can sell one cryptocurrency for another.
Both of these exchanges have SMLY markets.
<b>WARNING: In December 2017-January 2018 both these exchanges are going through transition periods! 
Wait until after January 20 before you try to use either one.</b>
</p>
<p>The following is currently the easiest method to buy SMLY for fiat (ordinary money)�.</p>
<p>
</p>

<li> Get an account at https://www.virwox.com/</li>
<li> Get an account at an exchange: https://tradesatoshi.com/, https://c-cex.com or https://novaexchange.com/</li>
<li> Deposit fiat (USD, GBP or EUR) using PayPal, VISA etc at https://www.virwox.com/</li>
<li> Buy SLL for fiat at https://www.virwox.com/</li>
<li> Buy BTC for SLL at https://www.virwox.com/</li>
<li> Transfer the BTC from https://www.virwox.com/ to your address at the exchange</li>
<li> Buy DOGE or LTC for BTC on the exchange</li>
<li> Buy SMLY for DOGE or LTC on the exchange</li>
<H2>
The winding way: Use the SMLY ATM
</H2>
Recently, experiments have been made with a SMLY ATM. This is a black-box into which one deposits Litecoin and gets back Smileycoin. A <a href="https://steemit.com/blockchain/@gstefans/more-messing-around-with-the-blockchain-an-atm-for-smly">document is available<�/a> describing the non-trivial process.

<H1>
<img src="smiley3.png" alt="Smileycoin�" height="42" width="42">
Selling SMLY for other cryptocurrencies
<a name="sell"></a>
<img src="smiley3.png" alt="Smileycoin�" height="42" width="42">
</H1>

<li> Get an account at an exchange: https://tradesatoshi.com/, https://novaexchange.com/ or https://c-cex.com </li>
<li> You can now deposit SMLY or other crypto into accounts at the exchange</li>
<li> Once you have any non-empty account, you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies</li>
<li> Note that SMLY is a <b>low-value</b> currency so make sure to use an appropriate market, SMLY-LTC or SMLY-DOGE</li>
<li> It is normally not a good idea to use the SMLY-BTC market directly. </li>
<H1>

Games using SMLY
<a name="game"></a>
<img src="smiley3.png" alt="Smileycoin�" height="42" width="42">
</H1>
The simplest game of all is the SMLY double-or-nothing game:

Deposit any (small) amount of SMLY to the address BCJW4iZw7PechFHgtqqSdHmymjnFA6LjNJ
and you will automatically participate in a double-or-nothing game.

If you are on a Windows, Linux or Mac computer then the easiest way to do this is in
the Console window, where you can give commands of the form
<pre>
sendtoaddress BCJW4iZw7PechFHgtqqSdHmymjnFA6LjNJ 20
</pre>
repeatedly and see how you sometimes get the double back and sometimes nothing.
